In this code, I have applied the Haversine formula for calculating the distance between two points on the map using their latitude () and longitude (), with the earth radius set from 6371km

Input Data:
geolocation_1: List of geolocation points (latitude and longitude) W is latitude and J is longitude
geolocation_2: List of geolocation points to match for shortest

The Haversine formula is used to calculate the distance between two points on the Earth's surface.
